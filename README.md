# ReadTex2DArray

### Example setup created to remind myself how to:

- Create a Texture2DArray in Unity
- Render something to it with a compute shader
- Read it back to CPU-side
- Render the results to screen (or to some surface.)

The information on these topics seems to be sparse and often one has to rely on fragments of information on the Unity forums, so I wrote this one down too for potential future use.
